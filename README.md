## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox more effectively and the relationship between containers and their items. 


### Continued development

I'd like to focus on tranitions and animation next time. 
I'd also like to continue to get more  comfortable with flexbox.
